  ARITH_module.vhd:  arithmetic module in VHDL
  ARITH_module.v:    arithmetic module in Verilog-HDL
  ARITH_mult_dc.v:   arithmetic module in Verilog-HDL, which is optimized for 
                     Design Compiler (Synopsys, Inc.) using GTECH Library.

  "ARITH_module.vhd", "ARITH_module.v", and "ARITH_module_dc.v" contain 
  the same content with different file formats.

  Each HDL file contains the design information (top module name and 
  user-defined specification) in the header.


Tips
----
  The generated description is optimized to implement the hardware algorithm.  
  So, "logic optimization" is not always effective for improving the circuit 
  performance.  In the case of Design Compiler, you should use the option
  "-only_design_rule" to obtain better results.

  Command example on dc_shell
    > compile -only_design_rule
