Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency today, and is an alternative to electronic cash transactions that take place through trusted third parties like banks. The third party transactions not only include a certain amount of transaction fees, but also take several days to process. These shortcomings of the conventional transaction systems can be overcome by peer-to-peer networking systems like bitcoin. The network uses a sturdy encryption system to maintain data integrity and protects the framework from fraudulent activities. The bitcoin network uses hashcash function which uses two iterations of SHA-256(Secure Hashing Algorithm), taking advantage of public key cryptography. SHA-256 is a one way encryption which creates a standard 256 bit hash data for any given input message. Our project focuses on implementing a ASIC capable hashcash model using SHA-256 for bitcoin hashing.
