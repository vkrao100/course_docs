\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper has presented an algebraic geometry notion of
Craig interpolants for a pair of polynomial ideals  in finite fields with no common 
solutions. An interpolant always exists in our setting as the variety of an 
elimination ideal. In addition to defining the smallest and the largest
interpolants, techniques are described to compute them using Gr\"obner basis concepts. 
The total number of interpolants
is also determined by counting the number of points in the 
variety of difference of the largest and the smallest interpolants. Over the field $\F_2$,
a technique is presented that can enumerate all the possible interpolants. 
Given an interpolant, an algorithm is provided that 
returns a list of progressively larger interpolants terminating in the largest
one. As part of future work, we will be pursuing heuristic based 
methods to compute interpolants and classify them according to 
their capability of abstraction.
