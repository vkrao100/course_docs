\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:prstmnt}

Under symbolic algebra environment, a given specification and its
circuit implementation are modeled as a set of polynomials. The
verification problem is then formulated as {\it membership
  testing} ~\cite{gb_book} and which can prove/disprove that the
circuit implements the specification. In the case of buggy circuits
the verification fails; faulty gate(s) are identified and a correction
is computed to rectify the circuit. The paper considers a single gate
fault model i.e., exactly one of the gates in the circuit is
incorrectly synthesized thereby implementing a wrong function at its
output. For example, an AND gate replaced with an XOR gate. Once a
particular gate has been identified as buggy, we label this gate as
the {\it unknown component}. We propose an approach to realize a
correction function which can be implemented at the output of this 
{\it unknown component}, such that the entire circuit implementation
conforms to the specification. Identifying the buggy gate in a given
circuit implementation is a much harder problem and is in the future
scope of our work. This paper puts forth the underlying theory on
realizing and exploring the solution space for correction functions,
and outlines the future verification challenges.
