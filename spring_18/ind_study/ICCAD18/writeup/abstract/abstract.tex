Resolving an unknown component is a fundamental problem encountered in
post-verification debugging and automatic correction of digital
circuits. Contemporary techniques rely on iterative/incremental
application of SAT solving and Craig interpolation to realize the
functionality of (or resolve) the unknown components. While these
techniques have achieved some success for control-dominated
applications (random logic circuits), they are infeasible in resolving
the unknown components in arithmetic circuits. This paper describes an
algebraic approach to resolve the functionality of an unknown
component in a finite field arithmetic circuit so that the circuit
implementation matches a given specification. Starting from an
equivalence checking setup modeled as a polynomial ideal
membership test in commutative algebra, we formulate the problem of
resolving the unknown component as a quantification procedure. Using
the \Grobner basis algorithm, we derive an approach to identify the
function implemented by the unknown component. We go on to pose the
problem as a synthesis challenge and explore the space of polynomial
functions for the unknown component by analyzing quotients of
ideals. As \Grobner basis algorithms exhibit high computational
complexity, we exploit the circuit topology to improve our
algorithms. We can resolve the unknown components not just for
bit-level circuit implementations, but also in cases where the
abstraction hierarchy is given at the level of (bit-vector)
words. Experiments performed over various finite field arithmetic
circuits demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our approach as
compared to conventional techniques.

% Automatic bug correction is a tedious and resource intensive process. 
%% Automatic correction of unknown components in a given circuit is a
%% resource intensive process. Recent developments in realizing the
%% functionality implemented by these unknown gates rely on incremental
%% SAT solving. Despite using state-of-the-art SAT solvers, these
%% approaches fail to verify multipliers beyond 12-bits and hence are
%% infeasible in a practical setting. The current formal datapath
%% verification methods which utilize symbolic computer algebra concepts,
%% rely heavily on textbook structure of the circuits to realize an
%% unknown component, and hence are not scalable. These approaches model
%% circuit as a set of polynomials over integer rings, and use function
%% extraction, simulation, and term rewriting using coefficient
%% computation to arrive at a solution. The approach is not complete in
%% the sense that the procedure cannot be extended to random logic
%% circuits and finite field circuits due to ambiguities in coefficient
%% computation. The approach also fails to verify circuits when redundant
%% gates are introduced in the design. To overcome all these limitations,
%% this paper describes a formal approach using finite field theory to
%% automatically realize the function implemented by an unknown
%% component, and verify the same. The paper introduces theory on
%% resolving a single unknown component using ideal membership testing
%% and \Grobner basis based reduction. We go onto pose the problem as a
%% synthesis challenge and extend the solution space of the unknown
%% component using concepts from quotient of ideals. Since the solution
%% space is not unique, we will also discuss a systematic, goal driven
%% search for simple implementable solutions. The paper presents results
%% on some preliminary experiments performed over various arithmetic
%% circuits to compare efficiency of our approach against recent methods.
