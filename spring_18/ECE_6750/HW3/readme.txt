the file names within directories are self explanatory.
*_core - file with computation part describing the arithmetic operations
*_env - environment/testbench to load the values
*_top - wrapper top binding all the ports for core and env

I was able to compile and simulate all the VHDL files successfully on modelsim version 10.5c.

directory structure -
hw3.6 - adder_ckt
	hw3 a - 1_bit_adder
	hw3 b - 4_1_bit_adder
