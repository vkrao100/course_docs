The program has been implemented in python
1. The bcp algorithm is implemented in the functions.py file which includes all the necessary functions as described in the algorithm.
2. The top-most function that invokes the bcp algorithm is implemented in the top.py
3. utility functions like parsing the input file, printing the matrix are implemented in utility.py

4. The program can be run via the shell script ./run.sh as
	./run.sh <input_file.txt>
	e.g.
	./run.sh simple.txt

5. The program was writtem on a machine with the python version 2.7.6. Please check that your python version has the module "copy" 
6. Also the parser is very basic so an extra space can give erroneous result.
