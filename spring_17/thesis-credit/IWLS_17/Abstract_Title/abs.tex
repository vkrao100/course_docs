Recent developments in formal datapath verification make efficient use 
of symbolic computer algebra algorithms for formal verification. The
circuit is modeled as a set of polynomials over Boolean (or
pseudo-Boolean) rings, and  Gr\"obner basis (GB) reductions are
performed over these polynomials to derive a canonical
representation. GB reductions of Boolean polynomials tend to cause
intermediate expression swell (term explosion problem) -- often making
the approach infeasible in a practical setting. To overcome these
problems,  this paper describes a logic synthesis analogue of GB
reductions over Boolean polynomials, using the unate cube set algebra
over characteristic sets. By representing Boolean polynomials as
characteristic sets using Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZBDDs), implicit
algorithms can be efficiently designed for GB-reduction on digital
circuits. We show that imposition of circuit-topology based monomial
orders on ZBDDs enables an implicit implementation of polynomial
division, canceling multiple monomials in one-step. 
%Other recent
%strategies of GB-reduction on circuits can also be implemented
%efficiently on ZBDDs. 
Experiments performed over various finite field
arithmetic architectures demonstrate the efficiency of our 
algorithms and implementations as compared to conventional explicit
methods.
