In this directory, I have put together the following manuscripts:

1. craig-interpolant-JSL.pdf
The original paper on Interpolants, by W. Craig. I think the last
theorem is what interpolation is about. Written in Greek and Latin.

2. pudlak-preprint.pdf
This is a  version of Pudlak's publication "Lower Bounds
for Resolution and Cutting-Plane Proofs and Monotone Computations, The
Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 62, No. 3 (Sep., 1997), pp. 981-998".

The first 2 sections tell us that Interpolants can also be used as
tools to analyze proof complexity! 

3. CAV03_mcmillan_interpolation_based_mc.pdf
This is the paper that introduced interpolants to our community. The
first 2 sections tell us what interpolants are and how to compute
them. Sec 3 onwards tells us how to use them as over-approximate image
operators in model checking.
