Galois fields have wide applications in the VLSI domain. This paper
describes a new approach to verify VLSI implementations of digital
circuits using Gr\"obner basis methods. The verification problem is
modeled as proving the infeasibility of a miter using Hilbert's
Nullstellensatz. Buchberger's algorithm is then applied to reason
about the variety of ideals corresponding to the VLSI
circuits. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this method
against contemporary SAT-based verification when applied to datapath
dominated applications.
